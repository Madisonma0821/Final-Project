//The user will see a group of scrambling letters in random order                                              *
//There will be TEN words in total and each word will have its hint                                            *
//Users can choose to see the hint/ continue without hint/ quit after failing guessing the word.               *
//This program is created by Douzi Ma and Lexin Li and Bisha Feng.                                             *
