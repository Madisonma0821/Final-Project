Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Prerequisites
 IDE (e.g Visual Studio, Codeblocks)
Installing
Step 1: Download
Goto http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads. Click "Download the binary release". Select your operating platform (e.g., Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7). Download the installer with GCC Compiler, e.g., codeblocks-13.12mingw-setup.exe (98 MB) (which includes MinGW's GNU GCC compiler and GNU GDB debugger).
Step 2: Install
Run the downloaded installer. Accept the default options.
Verify the Compiler's and Debugger's Path: (For CodeBlocks 13.12 For Windows) Goto "Settings" menu ⇒ "Compiler..." ⇒ In "Selected Compiler", choose "GNU GCC Compiler" ⇒ Select tab "Toolchain Executables" ⇒ Check the "Compiler's Installation Directory". It shall be set to the "MinGW" sub-directory of the CodeBlocks installation directory, for example, suppose that CodeBlocks is installed in "c:\Program Files\codeblocks", set it to "c:\Program Files\codeblocks\MinGW".
Similarly, check the debugger's path. Goto "Settings" menu ⇒ "Debugger..." ⇒ Expand "GDB/CDB debugger" ⇒ Select "Default" ⇒ In "Executable path", provide the full-path name of "gdb.exe", for example, “c:\Program Files\codeblocks\MinGW\bin\gdb.exe".
